# Installing Owlmic on Android

## Option 1: Download the APK (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/diveshpatil9104/mikey/releases)
2. Download the latest `Owlmic-vX.Y.Z-android.apk`
3. On your phone:
   - Open Settings → Security → enable "Install from unknown sources" for your browser (or Files app)
   - Open the downloaded APK and tap Install
4. Launch Owlmic

> **Note:** A signed APK and Google Play release are planned for v1.0.0.

## Option 2: Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (latest stable) - [download](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - Or: JDK 17+ with Android SDK command-line tools
- **CMake** - for the libopus native build
  - Android Studio: SDK Manager → SDK Tools → CMake
  - macOS: `brew install cmake`
  - Linux: `sudo apt install cmake`
- **Android phone** with USB debugging enabled (Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging)
- Minimum SDK: **26** (Android 8.0 Oreo)

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repo (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/diveshpatil9104/mikey.git
cd mikey

# Initialize submodules (libopus)
git submodule update --init

# Build the debug APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK is output to:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Install on Device
