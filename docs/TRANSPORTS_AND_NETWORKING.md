# Transports & Multi-Level Networking Architecture

Mikey automatically negotiates the optimal physical transport between the Android client and the PC companion across **four prioritized connection levels**. It dynamically upgrades connections using a **make-before-break** strategy and fails over within 2 seconds when an active medium is interrupted.

## 2. Detailed Transport Mechanics

### 2.1 Level 1: USB Debugging (ADB Reverse)
- **Mechanism**: The PC companion executes a lightweight background watcher thread (`pc/src/transport/adb.rs`) that continuously inspects attached Android devices via:
  ```bash
  adb devices -l
  ```
- **Port Reversal**: When an authorized device appears, the PC runs:
  ```bash
  adb -s <SERIAL> reverse tcp:7653 tcp:7653
  ```
- **Android Connection**: Android's `TcpTransport.adb()` establishes a connection to `127.0.0.1:7653`.
- **Characteristics**: Absolute lowest latency, zero jitter, immune to wireless RF interference. Unaffected by firewall configurations or subnet isolation.

### 2.2 Level 2: USB Tethering
- **Mechanism**: When USB tethering is activated, Android exposes a network interface (typically `rndis0`, `usb0`, or `ncm0`). Android runs a local DHCP server and assigns the PC an IP address on that private subnet.
- **Discovery**: `Discovery.kt` enumerates network interfaces, filters for names matching tether prefixes (`rndis`, `usb`, `ncm`), calculates the subnet-directed broadcast address (e.g. `192.168.42.255`), and emits a UDP probe on port `7654`.
- **The Cable Hint**: If a USB connection to a PC is detected (`ACTION_USB_STATE`) for > 3.0 seconds (`CABLE_HINT_AFTER_MS = 3_000`) without Level 1 or Level 2 connecting, `TransportManager` invokes `onCableHint(true)`, causing the UI to present a non-intrusive prompt: *"Tap to turn on USB Tethering"*.

### 2.3 Level 3: Wi-Fi / Local Area Network
- **Mechanism**: Standard TCP streaming over local WLAN.
- **UDP Discovery Beacon (`PORT_UDP_BEACON = 7654`)**:
  - The PC listens on `0.0.0.0:7654` (`pc/src/transport/beacon.rs`).
  - Android broadcasts a discovery packet containing:
    ```json
    { "mikey_probe": true, "version": 2, "device_id": "...", "device_name": "..." }
    ```
  - The PC responds directly to the sender's unicast address with:
    ```json
    { "mikey_pc": true, "version": 2, "pc_id": "...", "pc_name": "...", "port": 7653 }
    ```
- **Manual Address Fallback**: In restricted corporate or university networks where UDP broadcast packets are filtered by managed switches, Mikey provides `manualPcAddress` in Android settings to bypass discovery.
- **Wi-Fi Latency Lock (`WifiLatencyLock.kt`)**: Acquires an Android `WifiManager.WifiLock` with `WIFI_MODE_FULL_LOW_LATENCY` to instruct the wireless chipset to stay in high-power, low-latency mode.
- **Windows Firewall Detection & One-Click Elevation (`pc/src/firewall.rs`)**: On startup, when Wi-Fi or USB tethering is enabled, Mikey queries Windows Firewall for `Mikey TCP` (port 7653) and `Mikey UDP Beacon` (port 7654). If either rule is missing, a non-intrusive alert banner ("Wi-Fi Blocked — Allow Access") appears in the flyout. Clicking "Allow Access" triggers a single elevated UAC execution adding both rules without requiring manual terminal commands.

### 2.4 Level 4: Bluetooth RFCOMM
- **Mechanism**: Uses standard Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP).
- **UUID**:
  ```text
  00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
  ```
- **Android**: `BluetoothAdapter.getBondedDevices()` identifies paired PCs. `device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(SPP_UUID)` connects directly to the PC's Bluetooth radio.
- **PC Implementation**:
  - **Windows**: Standard WinSock using `AF_BTH` address family and `BTHPROTO_RFCOMM`.
  - **Linux**: BlueZ profile registration using the `bluer` crate (the only Tokio-dependent module in the entire PC project).
- **Audio-Only Constraint**: Because RFCOMM bandwidth is capped around 200–300 kbps in practice, video streaming is strictly disabled (`CameraBlock.BLUETOOTH`). Audio is compressed via Opus at 48 kbps CBR.

## 3. Make-Before-Break Upgrade Protocol

When Mikey is streaming on a lower-priority connection (e.g. Wi-Fi) and a higher-priority link becomes viable (e.g. the user plugs in a USB cable), Mikey executes a **make-before-break upgrade**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as SessionController (Android)
    participant Upgrader as mikey-upgrade Thread
    participant TM as TransportManager
    participant OldWire as Old Socket (Level 3 Wi-Fi)
    participant NewWire as New Socket (Level 1 USB)
    participant PC as SessionManager (PC)

    Note over App,PC: Live audio streaming on Level 3 Wi-Fi
    TM->>Upgrader: USB plug event (ACTION_USB_STATE) wakes waitForBetterChance()
    Upgrader->>TM: Request candidates better than Level 3
    TM-->>Upgrader: Return Level 1 (127.0.0.1:7653)
    Upgrader->>NewWire: Connect TCP socket
    Upgrader->>NewWire: Write Frame 0x00 (HELLO + pairing token, silent = true)
    NewWire->>PC: Verify token & active session
    PC-->>NewWire: Return Frame 0x10 (WELCOME, resumed = true)
    Note over Upgrader,PC: New connection fully verified!
    Upgrader->>App: Atomic handoff: better.set(newWire)
    App->>App: Swap active Wire reference and audio sender
    App->>OldWire: Write Frame 0x05 (BYE, reason = "switch")
    App->>OldWire: Close old socket
    Note over App,PC: Stream now active on Level 1 USB without gap!
```

### Key Make-Before-Break Implementation Rules:
1. **Silent Handshake (`silent = true`)**: Probing higher transports must **never trigger a user-facing prompt on the PC**. If a prospective connection returns `0x11 PENDING`, the candidate is immediately rejected as an upgrade option, preserving the uninterrupted current stream.
2. **Atomic Swap (`better.getAndSet(null)`)**: `SessionController.kt` checks for pending verified wires at the beginning of each transmission loop iteration.
3. **Graceful Teardown**: The old connection is notified via `BYE` with `reason = "switch"`, allowing the PC to update the active transport level in its session record without marking the session as disconnected.

## 4. Anti-Flapping Probation & Timing Constants

To ensure stability across flaky USB cables or marginal Wi-Fi signals, `TransportManager.kt` enforces precise timing controls:

```kotlin
companion object {
    /** A dead level is ignored for 10 s to prevent flapping between flaky transports. */
    const val DEAD_MS = 10_000L

    /** Probes occur every 1 s for the first 4 s after USB plug (waiting for adb reverse). */
    const val EARLY_PROBES_MS = 4_000L

    /** Regular background probe tick while USB is plugged in. */
    const val USB_TICK_MS = 5_000L

    /** Cable hint is displayed after 3 s if no USB level has successfully connected. */
    const val CABLE_HINT_AFTER_MS = 3_000L
}
```

- **`markDead(level)`**: When a socket throws an `IOException` during streaming, that level is blacklisted for 10,000 ms (`DEAD_MS`). Even if the interface is technically still up, the manager will not attempt to open it until the probation expires.
- **Probe Throttling**: Probing is event-driven (cable plugged, network lost/gained, Bluetooth bond state changed). The only periodic tick occurs when a USB cable is physically detected but not yet streaming over USB.
