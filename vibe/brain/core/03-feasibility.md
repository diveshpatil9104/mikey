# 3. Feasibility & Viability

## 3.1 Verdict summary

| Capability | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phone mic → PC virtual mic | ✅ Feasible | Proven pattern (WO Mic, AudioRelay). Needs a virtual audio device on Windows (VB-Cable, user-installed). |
| Phone camera → PC virtual webcam | ✅ Feasible, some effort | Windows: DirectShow virtual cam via `softcam` (Win10/11); Media Foundation virtual camera (Win11 only) as a later upgrade. Linux: `v4l2loopback`. |
| **Level 1 — USB debugging (ADB)** | ✅ Feasible, best quality | `adb reverse` tunnels the phone's `localhost:7653` to the PC. Truly plug-and-play *after* the user has enabled USB debugging once and tapped "Allow" once. Minority of users have debugging on. |
| **Level 2 — USB tethering** | ✅ Feasible | Standard network interface over USB. Subnet is **not** always `192.168.42.x` — must be discovered, not hardcoded. User must toggle tethering (Android does not let apps turn it on). |
| **Level 3 — Bluetooth** | ⚠️ Feasible for **audio only** | Classic Bluetooth RFCOMM gives ~0.5–1.5 Mbps in practice. Enough for Opus voice (32–64 kbps); **not enough for usable video**. Camera is disabled on this level with a clear message. |
| **Level 4 — Wi‑Fi / LAN** | ✅ Feasible | UDP broadcast discovery + TCP session. Blocked by client-isolated networks (some offices, hotels, guest Wi‑Fi) → manual IP fallback in Advanced. |
| Automatic upgrade between levels | ✅ Feasible | Event-driven probing on the phone + make-before-break session handover ([§ 10.6](../architecture/10-connection-levels.md)). |
| Noise suppression | ✅ Feasible | RNNoise on the **PC** (`nnnoiseless`, pure Rust, ~1–2% of a core). The phone sends raw audio. "Threshold" is implemented as a noise gate. |
| Echo cancellation | ⚠️ Feasible, **highest quality risk** | Must run on the **PC** (the echo comes from PC speakers; the phone can't hear the reference). Variable network latency and clock drift make AEC hard. Works best on USB. |
| Ask-before-join + tray prompt | ✅ Feasible | Native OS notification with Allow/Deny; tray menu fallback. |
| Phone settings persistence | ✅ Trivial | `SharedPreferences`. |
| Persistent notification while minimized | ✅ Required anyway | Android foreground service. |
| Swipe-away from Recents kills connection | ✅ Feasible | `stopWithTask` + `onTaskRemoved()`. A few OEM skins behave oddly; tested per device. |
| macOS PC side | ❌ Out of scope for v1 | Virtual camera needs a system extension; virtual mic needs a HAL plugin. Possible later. |

## 3.2 Viability

- **Market:** DroidCam, Iriun, WO Mic and AudioRelay exist, and newer Windows 11 builds and some Pixel phones offer built-in phone-as-webcam features. None of them combine *mic + camera + four automatic transports + zero-ritual startup + open source + Linux*. Mikey's edge is not a feature list — it is **how little the user has to do**.
- **Cost to run:** zero. No servers, no relay, no accounts. Distribution via GitHub releases (and optionally F-Droid).
- **Maintenance burden:** the real cost is platform churn — Android foreground-service rules change almost every release, and virtual devices depend on third-party drivers. The architecture isolates both behind small modules so they can be patched alone.
- **Biggest adoption friction:** the one-time install of virtual device drivers on the PC (VB-Cable on Windows, `v4l2loopback` on Linux). The PC app must detect missing pieces and guide the user in one click each.

## 3.3 Corrections to the original PRD (why the architecture changed)

These are real problems in PRD v0 that would have caused bugs or blocked features:

1. **"Daemon as a Windows service / system-wide systemd unit" does not work for this app.** Windows services run in session 0: they cannot show a tray icon or notifications, and they don't have the user's audio context. On Linux, PulseAudio/PipeWire are per-user, so a system-level unit cannot reach the user's audio server. → **Mikey for PC is now a per-user tray app** that autostarts at login (HKCU `Run` key on Windows, XDG autostart on Linux). No admin rights needed for the app itself.
2. **"No UI on the PC" conflicts with ask-before-join and preview.** → A minimal tray menu + one tiny preview window. Still no main window.
3. **USB tethering subnet is not fixed.** Many Android versions randomize the tether subnet. → Discovery over the tether interface instead of assuming `192.168.42.1`.
4. **Opus over TCP does not "handle packet loss gracefully".** TCP never shows loss to the app; it shows *delay*. Opus' loss concealment only helps over UDP. → v1 uses TCP everywhere with a latency cap (stale audio is dropped at the PC); an optional UDP media path for Wi‑Fi is planned ([§ 12.6](../architecture/12-wire-protocol.md)).
5. **mDNS via `NsdManager` can't be pinned to an interface** (needed for tether vs. Wi‑Fi). → Replaced with a tiny UDP broadcast beacon that works identically on every IP interface and removes the `mdns-sd` dependency.
6. **OBS Virtual Camera as a dependency is heavy** (a ~300 MB app) and injecting frames into it relies on OBS internals. → `softcam` (MIT, a small DirectShow DLL) on Windows.
7. **Echo cancellation on the phone can't work** for PC-speaker echo. → AEC stays on the PC, but the setting is exposed on the phone (settings sync over the control channel).
8. **Clock drift was not handled.** Phone mic and PC audio clocks differ slightly; over a long call a buffer grows or starves. → Adaptive resampling in the jitter buffer ([§ 13.1](../architecture/13-media-pipeline.md)).
9. **Open Wi‑Fi joining is a security hole.** With ask-before-join off, anyone on the same café/dorm Wi‑Fi with Mikey installed could pipe audio into your mic. → Trust-on-first-use for Wi‑Fi ([§ 11.3](../architecture/11-sessions-trust.md)), invisible for single-device users after the first click.
