# Mikey — Brain Index

> **Plug in. Tap once. Forget it exists.**
> Turn your Android phone into a mic and webcam for your PC — over USB, Bluetooth or Wi‑Fi — with no accounts, no ads, and no setup ritual.

The `vibe/` directory is the single source of truth for the Mikey project. It contains the product philosophy, technical architecture, wire protocols, UI/UX specs, coding standards, and operational playbooks.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 2 — The four levels, trust, and the real phone UI (Checklist: [core/roadmap.md](core/roadmap.md)).
- **Android (`android/`):** Phase 1 complete (TCP mic streaming over USB debugging, `MikeyService` foreground service). Builds with `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
- **PC (`pc/`):** Multi-transport tray app (`mikey`). TCP :7653, UDP beacon :7654, BT RFCOMM, SessionManager, Opus decoding, adaptive jitter buffer, drift resampler, tray menu, installers.
- **Next immediate step:** Phase 2 — Android Phase 2 (full UI per [phone-ux.md](core/phone-ux.md), `TransportManager`, Opus capture, pairing tokens) and completing PC Linux support.

## Key Facts

- Android: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, package `com.mikey`, min SDK 26.
- PC: Rust tray app, binary `mikey`, Windows 10/11 + Linux. TCP `7653`, UDP beacon `7654`.
- Connection levels, best first: 1 USB debugging › 2 USB tethering › 3 Bluetooth (audio only) › 4 Wi‑Fi.
- The phone is always the client; the PC is always the server.
- Mic and camera always start off. All audio processing runs on the PC.
