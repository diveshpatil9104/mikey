# 6. Phone App — UX Specification

## 6.1 Layout

The screen is split into two equal halves. Positions never change — the layout is locked to portrait; only glyphs and text rotate ([§ 6.4](phone-ux.md)).

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────── ˄ ───────────────┤  ← chevron, centered on the split line

│                                  │     off  = dimmed outline icon
│                                  │     on   = filled green icon + level meter ring
│                                  │
│                              [●] │  ← status dot, bottom-right
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Each half is one giant tap target.** Tap anywhere in the top half toggles the camera; anywhere in the bottom half toggles the mic.
- **Flip button** (top-left) sits diagonally opposite the status dot (bottom-right). It is a small dimmed circular button (40 dp, icon-off color, 0.6 alpha) and only appears while the camera is on. Tapping flips front ↔ back live.
- **Mic level ring:** when the mic is on, a thin ring around the mic icon reflects input level. This is the one allowed "live" element — it proves audio is actually flowing, which is the core honesty promise.
- **No labels.** Icons are universal. Accessibility labels are provided for TalkBack.

## 6.2 States

| Element | Off | On | Unavailable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Camera half | Dimmed outline icon | Live preview (optional, see Advanced) + filled blue icon | Icon with a slash + one-line reason on tap (e.g. *"Camera isn't available over Bluetooth"*) |
| Mic half | Dimmed outline icon | Filled green icon + level ring | Icon with slash + reason (e.g. permission denied) |
| Status dot | — | Green = streaming path live | Red = no PC · Amber = waiting for PC approval |

The status dot has three colors (not two) because *waiting for approval* is a real state the user must be told about; everything else stays binary.

## 6.3 Settings drawer (chevron)

A bottom sheet that slides up to ~60% height. One scroll, no nested screens. Closes on tap-outside or chevron. The **Advanced** section is collapsed by default — expanding it is the "extra click" for power users.

Notes:
- Flip camera is **not** in the drawer; it is the on-screen button. The last used lens is remembered.
- **All audio processing runs on the PC.** The phone only captures raw audio (and compresses it where the link needs it). This keeps the phone cool and battery-light, gives the echo canceller a clean signal, and makes quality identical on every phone brand.
- These settings are sent to the PC over the control channel; the phone is the single place the user sets them. They are greyed out if the PC reports it can't do them.

## 6.4 Rotation behaviour

- The activity is locked to portrait (`android:screenOrientation="portrait"`), so the layout never reflows and the activity is never recreated mid-stream.
- An `OrientationEventListener` snaps a `rotation` value to 0/90/180/270 (with ~20° hysteresis to avoid flicker). All icons and the drawer's text container rotate by that value. Positions stay fixed.
- Camera frames are rotated using the device orientation so the **PC always receives an upright image** regardless of how the phone is held. The phone preview matches.

## 6.5 Notification & lifecycle

A foreground service (`MikeyService`) owns the connection and all capture. The activity is only a remote control.

- **While connected**, the notification is always present (Android requires it) and shows: `Mic on · Camera off · USB` with actions **Mute/Unmute mic**, **Stop**.
- **Minimize / lock screen:** streaming continues. The notification reflects live state.
- **Swipe away from Recents:** `android:stopWithTask="true"` + `onTaskRemoved()` → send `BYE`, close transport, release mic and camera, stop service. The PC marks the device disconnected immediately (it received `BYE`) rather than waiting for a heartbeat timeout.
- **Stop in notification:** same as swipe-away, activity finishes if open.
- **Idle (connected, nothing streaming):** service stays up with the `connectedDevice` type so switching the mic on is instant. If the app is backgrounded and idle for 10 minutes, the service disconnects and stops to save battery.

**Android 14+ constraint (important):** a microphone or camera foreground service can only be *started* while the app is in the foreground. Therefore:
- Turning the mic/camera **on** happens only from the app UI.
- The notification's mic action is a **soft mute** (audio keeps being captured but silence is sent / sending pauses), which is allowed from the background. Unmute is also soft. Full release happens when the user turns the mic off in the app or stops the session.

## 6.6 Persistence ("local cache")

Everything the user sets is saved immediately to `SharedPreferences` and restored at next launch:

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| `camera.lens` | back |
| `camera.aspect` | 16:9 |
| `camera.quality` / `camera.fps` | auto / auto |
| `audio.ns` / `audio.nsStrength` | on / high |
| `audio.wifiLossless` | off |
| `audio.aec` | on |
| `audio.gateDb` | off |
| `ui.preview` / `ui.keepScreenOn` | on / off |
| `ui.rememberState` | off |
| `levels.enabled` | all four |
| `pc.lastId`, `pc.lastIp`, `pc.btAddress`, `pc.token` | — (learned) |
| `device.id` | random 128-bit, generated once |

**Mic and camera always start off** — this is a privacy promise. If *Remember mic/camera state* is turned on, Mikey restores the previous on/off state at launch (still only from the foreground, per Android rules).
